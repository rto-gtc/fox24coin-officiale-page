The NFT space is full of creativity and opportunity — but it also attracts scammers who will message you only for one reason:**to steal from you.**

These scammers act friendly, professional, or even generous, but every move they make is designed to **get access to your wallet or private keys.** 

### Here’s how to recognize the most common NFT scams on Twitter and Discord — and protect yourself before it’s too late.

### 1. “I’ll pay you more than your floor price” — the classic overpay trap
You list your NFT for 0.30 ETH. Suddenly, someone DMs you saying they’ll buy it for 1 ETH or even more — if you sell directly to them.

It feels exciting — but this is **100% a scam.**

They’re not here to buy; they’re here to make you rush and stop thinking clearly.
They’ll send fake links, ask you to sign “transfer” approvals, or redirect you to shady “verification” pages.
Once you approve a malicious contract, your wallet is compromised.

**Rule:** If an offer seems too good to be true — it is.
Only sell or transfer through verified marketplaces like OpenSea, Blur, or LooksRare. 

### 2. “I can’t use OpenSea — they blocked me” — the off-market excuse

Scammers often claim they are “big traders” or “whales” doing hundreds of deals, and therefore OpenSea or Blur has “blocked” them.
They’ll tell you they need to trade “directly” to avoid platform restrictions.

That’s a lie.
They want to move you off safe marketplaces and into private chats or fake sites where they can manipulate you freely.
There’s no valid reason for any real buyer to avoid reputable platforms.

**Rule:** Always insist on trading through official, trusted marketplaces. Never sign or send anything through private DMs.

### 3. “Join our Discord” — where the backdoors hide.
Another classic trick: the scammer invites you to a Discord server.
They promise “trade verification,” “airdrop claim,” or “giveaway confirmation.”
The server might look professional, but it’s built for one thing — phishing.

These fake Discords often contain malicious bots or links that request wallet connections.
Once you “connect” or sign something, you unknowingly give them full control over your assets.

**Rule:** Never join random Discords from DMs. Use only official project links from verified Twitter accounts or websites.

### 4. “We need a moderator to confirm the trade” — fake verification scam

Some scammers act like they’re following an official process.
They’ll say, “A Discord moderator needs to verify the transaction for security reasons.”
They may even bring in another fake “mod” or “admin” to appear legitimate.

This is **100% scam.**

No legitimate moderator ever asks to verify your trade, wallet, or transaction.
The more people involved, the more confusion they create — and the easier it is to steal from you without you realizing who did it.

**Rule:** No real moderator, ever, will need access to your wallet or require you to sign anything.

### 5. “You need to pay a gas fee first” — the approval scam

Scammers often claim you must “pre-pay” a small gas fee to “unlock” the trade or prove you’re serious.
In reality, they’re making you **approve a malicious contract** hat gives them unlimited access to your NFTs or tokens.

And here’s the worst part:
They don’t always drain your wallet right away.
Some wait days or weeks, until you’ve forgotten the interaction — and then they empty your assets silently.

**Rule:** Never send ETH or sign approvals just to “confirm” a sale. Always check what you’re signing using Etherscan or Revoke.cash.

### 6. Other red flags to watch for

* The account contacting you is new or has few followers.

Their name or PFP copies a well-known trader or project founder.

They use shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl).

They pressure you with urgency: “I’ll buy now, hurry before I change my mind!”

They ask you to “verify” your wallet or share your seed phrase.

**All of these are massive warning signs.**

### 7. How to stay safe

✅ Never share your seed phrase or private key.
✅ Don’t sign approvals for contracts you don’t fully understand.
✅ Use a **hardware wallet** for valuable NFTs.
✅ Keep trades on verified marketplaces.
✅ Revoke old contract approvals regularly.
✅ Double-check URLs before clicking.
✅ Report scam accounts to Twitter/X and the relevant marketplace.
✅ Educate others — scammers win when we stay silent.

### 8. If you got scammed — act fast

If you accidentally signed something or sent funds:

1. Go to [](https://revoke.cash/) and revoke any suspicious approvals.
2. Move all remaining assets to a new wallet.
3. Report the scam to the platform and share your experience publicly to warn others.

Time matters — every second counts.

### 9. Final thoughts

Scammers prey on emotion — greed, excitement, or urgency.
The moment you feel too excited about a deal, stop and think:
Would a real collector act like this? Would a real buyer skip OpenSea?

In 99% of cases, the answer is simple: no.

Protect your NFTs, protect your reputation, and protect your peace.
The best defense is awareness — share this post to help others avoid getting robbed.
