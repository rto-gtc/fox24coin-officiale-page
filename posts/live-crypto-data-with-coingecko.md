**In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, access to real-time, reliable data is not a luxuryâ€”it's a necessity. Thanks to powerful APIs like CoinGecko, we can integrate live market data directly into our platform, providing up-to-the-minute information for our users.**

In this post, we'll show you how powerful APIs can be by integrating a live cryptocurrency price table directly into our blog.

### What is CoinGecko?

CoinGecko is a leading independent cryptocurrency data aggregator that tracks thousands of assets across hundreds of exchanges worldwide. Its API is a powerful tool for developers to build rich, data-driven applications.

### Live Top 100 Crypto Prices

Below is a live-updating table showcasing the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The data is embedded from a separate page and fetched directly from the CoinGecko API.

### How Does It Work?

This dynamic table is actually a separate, self-contained HTML page that has been embedded into this post using an `<iframe>` tag.

1.  **Embedding:** We use an `<iframe>` to create a window to another HTML page directly within our article's content.
2.  **Client-Side Fetch:** That separate HTML page contains a JavaScript script. When you load this post, the script runs inside the iframe in **your browser**.
3.  **Live Data:** The script calls the CoinGecko API, retrieves the latest market data for 100 coins, and builds the table you see above. It also includes a live search function that filters the results instantly.

This method is great for embedding complex, self-contained applications into a post while keeping the post's content clean and simple.
