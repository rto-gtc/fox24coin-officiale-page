        <section id="privacy-policy">
            <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Policy</h2>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy outlines the rules for the processing and protection of personal data of users using the Fox24Coin website (hereinafter referred to as "we", "our", or "the service"). Security and transparency are our priorities. We are committed to protecting your personal data in accordance with applicable laws, particularly Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), known as "GDPR". This document aims to inform you in detail about what data we collect, for what purpose, on what legal basis, and what rights you have in this regard.
            </p>

            <h3>2. What Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>While you use our service, depending on the nature of your interaction, we may collect and process the following categories of data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personal and Identification Data:</strong> This includes information you provide voluntarily, such as your first and last name, email address, and in the case of full registration or identity verification (KYC), also your phone number, residential address, or data from your identity document. We also collect information related to your transactions, such as cryptocurrency wallet addresses, amounts, and transaction history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Technical and IT Data:</strong> We automatically collect information about the device you use, including its unique identifier, model, operating system type and version, and web browser. A key element is the IP address, which may be used for approximate geolocation, security purposes, and analytics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Usage Data (Behavioral):</strong> We analyze your activity on the service. We collect information about the pages you visit, the time spent on each, the links you click, your navigation paths, and the source from which you arrived at our site. This helps us understand how users use our services and how we can improve them.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Purpose of Data Processing</h3>
            <p>We process your personal data for strictly defined, transparent, and legitimate purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Providing cryptocurrency-related services:</strong> This is the primary purpose of processing. The data is necessary to create and maintain an account, execute transactions, provide technical support, and fulfill our contractual obligations to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sending marketing communications:</strong> If you give your separate, voluntary consent, we will use your email address to send newsletters, information about promotions, new products, and important events. You always have the option to easily withdraw this consent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Analyzing and improving the service:</strong> Usage and technical data, often in anonymized or aggregated form, allow us to understand user needs, optimize site performance, introduce new features, and improve the overall User Experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ensuring security and fraud prevention:</strong> We monitor activity on the service to detect and prevent unauthorized access, money laundering (AML), fraud, and other activities that are illegal or violate our terms of service. Your IP address and technical data are crucial in this process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fulfilling legal obligations:</strong> As a financial service provider, we may be legally required to collect, verify, and store certain data for a specified period, for purposes such as tax reporting or legal proceedings.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
            <p>Every data processing operation is based on one of the following legal grounds, in accordance with Art. 6 of the GDPR:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong> This applies to activities you voluntarily agree to, such as receiving marketing communications or installing non-essential cookies. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contractual Necessity (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> We process your data to be able to provide the services you order from us. Without this data, fulfilling the contract (e.g., maintaining your account) would be impossible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legitimate Interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> We process data to pursue our legitimate interests, such as statistical analysis, improving service quality, direct marketing of our products, and ensuring system security. We always ensure that our interests do not override your rights and freedoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legal Obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR):</strong> We process data when required by law, such as anti-money laundering or tax regulations.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Data Retention Period</h3>
            <p>
                We store personal data only for as long as is strictly necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as long as required by law. The retention period may vary depending on the type of data and the purpose of processing. For example, transaction-related data may be stored for 5 years due to tax regulations. After this period, the data is permanently and securely deleted from our systems or anonymized, meaning it can no longer be linked to a specific individual.
            </p>

            <h3>6. User Rights</h3>
            <p>Under the GDPR, you have several rights regarding your personal data. You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access your personal data:</strong> You can request information about what data of yours we process and receive a copy of it.</li>
                <li><strong>Rectify (correct) data:</strong> If you believe your data is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request its update.</li>
                <li><strong>Erase data ("right to be forgotten"):</strong> You can request the deletion of your data, provided we are not legally obligated to continue storing it.</li>
                <li><strong>Restrict processing:</strong> You can request that we limit the processing of your data to storage only in certain situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit it to another controller.</li>
                <li><strong>Object to processing:</strong> You can object to the processing of your data based on our legitimate interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time:</strong> If processing is based on consent, you can withdraw it at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
                <li><strong>Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</strong> If you believe your data is being processed unlawfully, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (PUODO) in Poland.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise your rights, please contact us via the contact form on our website or through the contact details provided at the end of this document.</p>

            <h3>7. Data Security</h3>
            <p>
                We take the security of your data very seriously. We implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. We use, among other things, connection encryption (SSL/TLS), access controls, regular security audits, pseudonymization, and we train our employees on data protection.
