## 🧠 Project Philosophy

> “Technology means nothing without transparency.”

The site was developed manually — written in a simple text editor and built line-by-line through the developer console.  
Every section is optimized for clarity, transparency, and education.  
Fox24Coin stands for open communication, verified data, and community-driven growth.

## ⭐ Developer Feedback

> *"As the creator of Fox24Coin, I’m proud of the transparency and security of our project.  
> The site is protected by Cloudflare and our own custom code.  
> It’s not perfect yet — we still have some visual refinements to make —  
> but every element here was written by hand, from zero.  
> I give it 6 stars for now, but we’ll work toward the full score together."*
